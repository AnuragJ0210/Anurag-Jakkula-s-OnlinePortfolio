      <p>In this project, I designed a VEXcode VR program that analyses an obstacle-free path for a VR-SDV virtual robot. In this project, we were given multiple 2-D lists, which had a given starting point (represented by a 3), various obstacles (represented by 2s), and an end-point (represented by 1s).  At first, I designed a semi-smart algorithm which could distinguish between the four lists using conditionals which evaluated based upon the location of obstacles. However, afterwards, I was able to develop a smart algorithm which would work with any given 5x5 2-D list. Both my smart algorithm and semi-smart algorithm use mathematical and logical concepts such as logical operators, boolean operators, and arithmetic operators. Logical operators are used throughout to aid conditional statements. For example, in my smart algorithm’s functions, logical operators are used to decide which direction the VEX car should go due to obstacles and boundaries. Arithmetic operators were used in my movement functions to track the VR-SDV’s list position in the Row and Column variables. Abstraction was useful to create clean, easy to read code.</p>

      <p>The Python escape room which my partner and I developed evaluates a student’s preparedness to partake in hybrid learning as it tests on the precautions and safety procedures that are to be followed in order to maintain safety. The questions are both free response and multiple choice. They cover topics about COVID safety, real life scenarios in which the user has to make a decision, and factual information about the global pandemic. The user must answer a question correctly to move on to the next question. The user starts off with 30 points, and has 5 points deducted for every wrong answer. If the user is capable of getting through all three questions with at least 15 points left, the user is rewarded with permission to participate in hybrid learning. In this project, we utilized functions, conditionals, modules, local variables, global variables, and arithmetic operators to create elegant, function based code. In this project, loops were not allowed. Therefore, our functions make up an elegant, modular Python program, where functions interact with each other. In addition, the package Termcolor was used to color certain aspects of the output.</p>

      <p>Our project is a motivation and mental health tool that is built to motivate people, especially high school teenagers, who need a source of motivation during tough times. The project will include a calm lake symbolizing stability. Furthermore, there will be a calming flower on a lilypad in the middle. This represents inner peace with oneself. The program will ask for user input whether they are interested in sports, music, school, and art or not. For every genre that the user says yes to, the relevant items will be drawn. This is meant to provide hope for the user and show them that they can do what they are interested in for encouragement. There will also be motivational messages that cycle through a list. These motivational messages are based on user-input on how they are feeling. This project is built through the Python programming language using the Turtle package. The planning and execution of our program was done in the scrum methodology. This greatly helped us in the developmental process since we were able to reevaluate scope regularly. I played an active role on the team. The greatest difficulty was learning Python turtle. The process helped me gain the knack for understanding libraries.</p>

      <p>Our primary objective for this Hangman game is to fulfill all six rows of the AP Create Task requirements. Our secondary objective for making this Hangman game was for the user to have an interactive game which prompts the user to participate. The secondary objective of the game is for user enjoyment. The game should be easy to use. The project must be an entertaining game for the user which is easy to understand and at the same time challenging. Our overall goal was to make a functioning Hangman game where if the user guesses a letter in a particular word, the letter shows up in the middle of dashes representing hidden letters. However, the primary purpose of this application is to incorporate the requirements for the College Board create task, which we were successful in doing. I was an active team member. The most difficult part of this project was fulfilling all rubric requirements, which we fulfilled through systematic brainstorming.</p>
