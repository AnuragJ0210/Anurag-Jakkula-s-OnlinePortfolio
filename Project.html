      <p>In this project, I designed a VEXcode VR program that analyses an obstacle-free path for a VR-SDV virtual robot. In this project, we were given multiple 2-D lists, which had a given starting point (represented by a 3), various obstacles (represented by 2s), and an end-point (represented by 1s).  At first, I designed a semi-smart algorithm which could distinguish between the four lists using conditionals which evaluated based upon the location of obstacles. However, afterwards, I was able to develop a smart algorithm which would work with any given 5x5 2-D list. Both my smart algorithm and semi-smart algorithm use mathematical and logical concepts such as logical operators, boolean operators, and arithmetic operators. Logical operators are used throughout to aid conditional statements. For example, in my smart algorithm’s functions, logical operators are used to decide which direction the VEX car should go due to obstacles and boundaries. Arithmetic operators were used in my movement functions to track the VR-SDV’s list position in the Row and Column variables. Abstraction was useful to create clean, easy to read code.</p>

      <p>The Python escape room which my partner and I developed evaluates a student’s preparedness to partake in hybrid learning as it tests on the precautions and safety procedures that are to be followed in order to maintain safety. The questions are both free response and multiple choice. They cover topics about COVID safety, real life scenarios in which the user has to make a decision, and factual information about the global pandemic. The user must answer a question correctly to move on to the next question. The user starts off with 30 points, and has 5 points deducted for every wrong answer. If the user is capable of getting through all three questions with at least 15 points left, the user is rewarded with permission to participate in hybrid learning. In this project, we utilized functions, conditionals, modules, local variables, global variables, and arithmetic operators to create elegant, function based code. In this project, loops were not allowed. Therefore, our functions make up an elegant, modular Python program, where functions interact with each other. In addition, the package Termcolor was used to color certain aspects of the output.</p>
