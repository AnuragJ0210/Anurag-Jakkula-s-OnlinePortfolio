      <p>I am determined to gain the necessary skills to create and apply solutions for real-world pressing problems: the needs are quite evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, Operation Warp Speed, food insecurity, climate change, etc., where data-driven and applications-based computer science technologies are becoming a major asset. I hope to contribute to this interest of mine by pursuing data science.</p>

In middle school, when participating in a Destination Imagination Engineering Challenge, I was enthralled when studying how load-bearing capacity to mass ratio of a wooden structure could be optimized by iterative methodology. Since then, eager to share knowledge and interest in STEM with fellow high school peers, with the Helyx Initiative I contributed blogs and graphics to engage students with the realm of bioinformatics. Eager to use transformative AI-based technologies to impact traditional healthcare structures, last summer I worked with a three-person Empower and Excel volunteer team to develop a blood donation application that streamlines donor-patient interactions. As an Inspirit AI summer participant,  I explored AI subfields through case discussions, learned the mathematics behind ML algorithms such as neural networks, and now apply skills by competing in hackathons and tech challenges (DEDA Entrepreneurship Competition: Showcase Qualifier, Nucleotide Hackathon, GiveBackHacksII: Social Good Award). My previous ML and AI endeavors include an application that utilizes convolutional neural networks to detect skin cancer through patient skin images and an application that helps farmers predict the best crops to grow in certain soil conditions utilizing a neural network (earned Social Good Award).</p>
Recently, with ASDRP’s Johnson Group Data Science Project, I have deepened my computational analysis skills as a data science researcher working with SQL-based research of soil quality (earned Excellence in Research award). Building upon this research, I now am conducting a scholarly literature review – Resilience to Hazards, Reduce Risk of Pollution-causing Chemicals – to investigate environmental contamination, releases of toxic chemicals, and potential AI and ML solutions.</p>
