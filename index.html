        <p>As someone who considers the happiness of the world as his own, my underlying goal in life is to better the world. Intending to be a computer scientist and data scientist, I look forward to pulling society closer together and closer to facts as well. Some of my individual goals include creating applications to connect the wealthy with the poor, integrating live visual statistics on world issues into social media applications, and utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to make breakthroughs in other scientific fields. My plan for achieving this career goal is by working hard to keep my grades up, improving my computer science skills, and keeping an eye on world issues along the way.
</p>

          <p>My goal of bettering the world with computer science needs both soft skills and technical skills. As for soft skills, I am an empathetic, motivating, and pleasant person. My friends seek support from me, and I am always happy to do my absolute best to hold them up when they are at their low point. I understand people’s situations, and I know that getting angry is invalid, since a person’s issues are likely due to many unrelatable factors. As a result, everyone deserves help, no matter what. I motivate during school projects. Around people, I always keep a smile on my face and be as calm as possible at all times. I demonstrate my caring personality as a SEWA and Empower and Excel volunteer. As a SEWA volunteer, I participate in food distribution for the poor, and as an Empower and Excel volunteer, I make food, blankets, and scarves for the homeless. Such soft skills will come in handy in the extremely collaborative field of computer science since I can understand and empathize with both people and their issues. 
</p>

        <p>As for technical skills, I believe that I have strong arithmetic, coding, and writing skills. As I am taking Precalculus in ninth grade, I am comfortable with rigorous mathematical concepts. As an aspiring computer scientist, I regularly learn new concepts on Codecademy in my free time. I am also currently taking the AP Computer Science Principles course at my high school. I have experience with MIT App Inventor, Python, HTML, CSS, and machine learning. I have made the top 20 teams in the Global Nucleotide Hackathon and earned a Social Good Award in GiveBackHacksII. Also, I am a good writer and am therefore good at expressing my ideas. I can write quality works of all types, such as research papers, project documentation, argumentative papers, and emails. Although I have the types of skills necessary to be successful in my dream path, I am always on the lookout for opportunities to improve upon them. The more I sharpen these skills, the better I will be able to serve the world. Thank you for your time! Please feel free to explore the rest of my website.
